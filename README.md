# End-to-End MLOps + DevOps Platform Engineer Project: Scalable AI Platform for Real-Time Anomaly Detection with LLM Integration

## Project Overview
We are going to build a *real-time anomaly detection system* that integrates a *large language model (LLM)* for generating insights from detected anomalies. The system includes:
1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: Real-time data streaming and preprocessing using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.
2. Anomaly Detection Model: Training and deploying a machine learning model for anomaly detection.
3. LLM Integration: Fine-tuning and deploying a large language model to generate insights from detected anomalies.
4. Feature Store: Managing features for the anomaly detection model using Feast.
5. MLOps Pipeline: Automating the ML lifecycle with MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
6. Monitoring and Alerting: Implementing monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack.
7. Infrastructure Automation: Automating cloud infrastructure setup using Terraform.
