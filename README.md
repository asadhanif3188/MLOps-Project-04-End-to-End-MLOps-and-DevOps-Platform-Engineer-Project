    - **Description:**
        - Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) on a custom dataset to generate insights from detected anomalies (e.g., "Anomaly detected: Possible equipment failure due to temperature spike").
        - Deploy the fine-tuned LLM as a separate service using Docker and Kubernetes.
        - Integrate the LLM with the anomaly detection system to provide actionable insights in real-time.

6. **Monitoring and Alerting**
    - **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
    - **Description:**
        - Implement monitoring and alerting for the anomaly detection system and LLM using Prometheus and Grafana.
        - Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and analyzing system logs.
        - Set up alerts for anomalies, model performance degradation, and system failures.
7. **Infrastructure Automation**
    - **Tools:** Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure
    - **Description:**
        - Automate the setup of cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs, Kubernetes clusters, storage) using Terraform.
        - Deploy the entire system on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
