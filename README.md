## **Project Components**

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
    - **Tools:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
    - **Description:**
        - Set up a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka to stream time-series data (e.g., sensor data, transaction logs).
        - Use Apache Spark for preprocessing the data (e.g., cleaning, feature extraction, normalization).
        - Store the processed data in a feature store (Feast) for model training and inference.
2. **Anomaly Detection Model**
    - **Tools:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes
    - **Description:**
        - Train an anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) on the preprocessed data.
        - Use MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and managing the ML lifecycle.
        - Containerize the model using Docker and deploy it on Kubernetes for scalability.
        - Implement a REST API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the model for real-time inference.
3. **LLM Integration**
    - **Tools:** Hugging Face Transformers, Docker, Kubernetes
    - **Description:**
        - Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) on a custom dataset to generate insights from detected anomalies (e.g., "Anomaly detected: Possible equipment failure due to temperature spike").
        - Deploy the fine-tuned LLM as a separate service using Docker and Kubernetes.
        - Integrate the LLM with the anomaly detection system to provide actionable insights in real-time.
4. **Feature Store**
    - **Tools:** Feast
    - **Description:**
        - Implement a feature store using Feast to manage and serve features for the anomaly detection model.
        - Use the feature store to ensure consistency between training and inference pipelines.
5. **MLOps Pipeline**
    - **Tools:** MLflow, GitHub Actions/Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes
    - **Description:**
        - Automate the ML lifecycle using MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment.
        - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the deployment of the anomaly detection model and LLM.
        - Use Docker and Kubernetes to containerize and orchestrate the services.
6. **Monitoring and Alerting**
    - **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
    - **Description:**
        - Implement monitoring and alerting for the anomaly detection system and LLM using Prometheus and Grafana.
        - Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and analyzing system logs.
        - Set up alerts for anomalies, model performance degradation, and system failures.
7. **Infrastructure Automation**
    - **Tools:** Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure
    - **Description:**
        - Automate the setup of cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs, Kubernetes clusters, storage) using Terraform.
        - Deploy the entire system on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
